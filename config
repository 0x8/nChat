# This file allows the user to set some pre-configured options to avoid being
# asked when the program starts. The options in this file are
# 
# rsadir: The path to the rsa dump that takes place on initial key creation and
#         on program completion. It simply contains your public and private keys
#
# username: Youre desired username. Will be prefixed to messages sent
#
# password: Password desired to authenticate with. It is not only ok, but
#           advised to leave this one blank but I leave that up to you
# 
# All entries are in the form <key>=<value> though <key> = <value> is also fine.
# All lines beginning with # are comments and ignored by the parser so comment
# away. I have added a few defaults for you.

# RSA key bits
rsa_bits = 4096

# RSA Key directory
rsadir=/home/nullp0inter/.ssh/

# Username
username=nullp0inter

# Password used to auth to pickier users.
password=Gr4gn0r
