# nchat Secure P2P Client
nchat was originally designed for a Network Security course I took during my final semester of University in Spring 2017

nchat makes use of RSA and AES in an attempt to create a custom, secure instant messaging service employing tactings such as "Perfect Forward Security".

I organized the project as well as I could given the time constraints and actually may go back when I have time to fix it up and see if I can't remedy some of it's shortcomings when not under the pressure of a deadline.

Please note this project was made under tight time constraints with extremely low sleep. There **_are_** errors and it is more intended as a "Proof-of-Concept" than a robust chatting solution.
